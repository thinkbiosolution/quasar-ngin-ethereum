## Set up server environment

We need a server to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

* Install Node.js
	* Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/ ).
	* Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for Windows.
	* Run the installer and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to include npm (Node Package Manager).

* Initialize a Node.js project and install necessary packages

	```bash
	mkdir ethereum-api
	cd ethereum-api
	npm init
	npm install express web3
	```

* Create a server script (e.g., server.js) to interact with the Ethereum smart contract.
* Setting up the API

	Replace `'YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL'`, `contractABI, and 'YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS' with the appropriate values for the Ethereum environment and smart contract. This script sets up two endpoints: /addDataPoint for adding data points and /getDataPoints/:userId for retrieving data points for a specific user ID.
